AWS S3 Interview Questions and Answers (with Terraform & Ansible)

1. What is Amazon S3?
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. 
It is used to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.

2. What are the different storage classes in S3?
S3 Standard – Frequent access

S3 Intelligent-Tiering – Automatic cost optimization

S3 Standard-IA – Infrequent Access

S3 One Zone-IA – Infrequent access in a single AZ

S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval – Archival with fast access

S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval – Archive with flexible retrieval

S3 Glacier Deep Archive – Lowest cost, long-term storage

3. What is the difference between S3 and EBS?
Feature	S3	EBS
Type	Object Storage	Block Storage
Access Method	HTTP(S)	Attach to EC2
Use Case	Backup, static content	Databases, filesystems
Pricing	Per GB stored	Per provisioned GB/month

4. How do you make an S3 bucket public?
Disable "Block Public Access" in bucket settings.

Add a bucket policy like:
{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement":[{
    "Sid":"PublicRead",
    "Effect":"Allow",
    "Principal": "*",
    "Action":["s3:GetObject"],
    "Resource":["arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name/*"]
  }]
}
5. What are S3 Bucket Policies?
Bucket policies are JSON-based access control policies attached directly to a bucket. They define who can access what within that bucket.

Example:
{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement":[{
    "Effect":"Deny",
    "Principal": "*",
    "Action":"s3:DeleteObject",
    "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*",
    "Condition":{
      "StringNotEquals":{
        "aws:username":"admin"
      }
    }
  }]
}
6. How do you enable versioning in an S3 bucket?
Via AWS Console: Enable from bucket properties.

Via CLI:
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket my-bucket --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled

7. What is S3 Lifecycle policy?
It automates transitions of objects to cheaper storage or deletion based on age.

Example actions:

Move to Glacier after 30 days

Delete after 365 days

8. How to host a static website on S3?
Enable Static Website Hosting in bucket properties.

Upload index.html, error.html.

Make bucket public or use CloudFront + OAI.


9. How to use Terraform to create an S3 bucket?

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "my-unique-bucket-name"
  acl    = "private"

  tags = {
    Name        = "MyBucket"
    Environment = "Dev"
  }
}
To add versioning:

resource "aws_s3_bucket_versioning" "example" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id

  versioning_configuration {
    status = "Enabled"
  }
}
To add a bucket policy:
resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "example" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id
  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17",
    Statement = [
      {
        Effect    = "Allow",
        Principal = "*",
        Action    = "s3:GetObject",
        Resource  = "${aws_s3_bucket.example.arn}/*"
      }
    ]
  })
}

10. How to use Ansible to upload a file to S3?
Example using community.aws.s3 module:

- name: Upload file to S3
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Upload file
      community.aws.s3:
        bucket: my-bucket
        object: backup/config.yaml
        src: /etc/config.yaml
        mode: put
        region: ap-south-1
      vars:
        aws_access_key: "{{ lookup('env','AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID') }}"
        aws_secret_key: "{{ lookup('env','AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY') }}"

        
11. What are pre-signed URLs in S3?
Pre-signed URLs allow you to grant time-limited access to private S3 objects.

Generate via CLI:
aws s3 presign s3://my-bucket/myfile.zip --expires-in 3600


12. What is S3 Object Lock?
S3 Object Lock prevents objects from being deleted or overwritten for a specified amount of time, using WORM (Write Once Read Many).

13. Is S3 region-specific?
Yes, S3 buckets are created in specific regions, but the bucket name must be globally unique.

14. How do you secure S3 buckets?
Enable bucket policies and IAM roles

Use S3 Block Public Access

Enable encryption (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS)

Enable versioning and MFA delete

Use CloudTrail for logging access

15. Can you mount S3 as a file system?
Yes, using tools like:

s3fs-fuse – Mount S3 as a Linux file system

AWS DataSync or AWS Transfer Family
