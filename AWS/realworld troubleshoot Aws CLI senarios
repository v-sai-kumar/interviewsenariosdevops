A Lambda function is failing silently. How do you pull logs via CLI?

Use: aws logs get-log-events

How do you list all available log groups and their retention periods?

How do you create a snapshot of an RDS instance before applying a patch?

Use: aws rds create-db-snapshot

You want to clone an existing RDS into another environment.

Use: aws rds restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot


‚öôÔ∏è IAM Scenarios
How would you verify if a user can launch EC2 instances?

Use: aws iam simulate-principal-policy

How can you identify all users with S3 full access?

Use: aws iam list-users + list-attached-user-policies

A new team member needs read-only access to EC2. How do you provide that?

Use: aws iam attach-user-policy

‚ò∏Ô∏è EKS Scenarios

üì¶ ECR Scenarios
You need to push a new Docker image to ECR. What steps do you perform via CLI?

Use: aws ecr get-login-password | docker login ...
docker tag ...
docker push ...

How do you clean up old image tags in a repository?

Use: aws ecr list-images, then aws ecr batch-delete-image

üåê Route53 & CloudFront Scenarios
How would you check if a DNS record exists for app.example.com?

Use: aws route53 list-resource-record-sets

After updating an S3 website, content is stale. How do you invalidate CloudFront cache?

Use: aws cloudfront create-invalidation

üìã Tagging & Cost Scenarios
How do you find all resources tagged as Owner=DevOps?

Use: aws resourcegroupstaggingapi get-resources

Your monthly AWS bill spiked. How do you break down costs by service?

Use: aws ce get-cost-and-usage


üõ†Ô∏è Bonus Automation Scenarios
You need to automate a daily health report across EC2, RDS, and S3. Which commands would you include?

How do you set up a cron job to sync local logs to S3 every night?

How would you write a shell script to restart EC2 instances in a specific tag group during non-business hours?
